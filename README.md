Bank Transaction Analytics & Fraud Detection Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository contains a complete Power BI project designed to analyze bank transactions, detect fraud patterns, and provide deep insights into transaction behavior across customers, devices, and network slices.

📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a unified analytics dashboard where banking analysts can:

    •	Monitor transaction volume and patterns
    
    •	Identify failed vs successful transactions
    
    •	Detect fraud trends using key indicators
    
    •	Analyze geographic transaction behavior

View detailed transaction logs with filtering options

The report is divided into three main pages:

🏠 1. Home Dashboard

Provides a summary-level view of overall banking activity:

Key KPIs

    •	Total Transactions
    
    •	Total Transaction Amount
    
    •	Trend of transactions over time


Visualizations

    •	Bar chart: Transactions by Fraud Flag 
    
    •	Doughnut charts
    
    •	By Transaction Status (Success / Failed)


🔐 2. Fraud Detection Dashboard

Focuses on fraud patterns and anomalies.

Key Insights

    •	Fraud transactions by Bandwidth Group
    
    •	Fraud transactions by Network Slice ID
    
    •	Ratio of Success vs Failed in fraud-related activity
    
    •	Fraud-related geographic distribution


This page helps identify suspicious networks, devices, and regions.

📄 3. Transaction Detail Page

A complete tabular dataset with:
    
    •	Transaction ID
    
    •	Sender & Receiver Account ID
    
    •	Transaction Type
    
    •	Transaction Amount
    
    •	Fraud Flag
    
    •	Transaction Status (with icons)
    
    •	Bandwidth Group
    
    •	Network Slice ID
    
    •	Time

  Users can filter on:
  
    •	Transaction Type
    
    •	Status
    
    •	Device Used
    
    •	Network Slice


🎯 Project Outcome

This dashboard helps banking teams:

Detect fraud early

    •	Understand customer behavior
    
    •	Improve oversight of network performance
    
    •	Make data-driven operational decisions
    
    •	By Transaction Type (Transfer, Deposit, Withdrawal)
    
    •	Global map showing transaction distribution
